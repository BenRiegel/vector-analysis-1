# Simple Vector Analysis

This project demonstrates some simple vector data analysis using python and the geopandas package. In a jupyter notebook, I walk through the steps of reading vector data into a geodataframe, subsetting the data, dissolving features, reprojecting the data, calculating area, and finally saving the resulting data to a new file.

The "data" folder for the project contains the main input dataset "maine_counties.shp". This file contains the feature boundaries that make up all the counties in Maine. The python code is contained in the notebook "analysis.ipynb". The file "hancock.shp" is the outfile dataset. The "environment.yml" file contains a list of all the python packages that the code requires to work.
